- We need to have a system where we have the NPCs core emotions table. This is their kinda long term state.
- Then when put into a situation we take the base emotions and then apply the situation modifiers to them, this allows use to simulate the human behavior of putting on a front, or acting differently based on the situation. In particular we can also reason about emotional changes caused by a particular person being present, or the a given environment (for example, a loud party or a quiet library).
- We can build a record of public expections / normal for different situations. But it's also key a persons personality traits, which can influence their behavior and emotional responses.
- A really key thing is that it should be possible to store a history of how somebody used to behave vs how they currently behave. This allows us to track changes in behavior over time and understand the underlying reasons for those changes. But also allows for the NPCs to roll that into their conversions. For example I used to be afraid of heights, but now I'm not. I used to be shy and introverted, but now I'm more outgoing and confident.

What to do about these things?

- There should be certain trigger words or phrases, or concepts raised in a conversation that can trigger a change in the NPC's emotional state. For example, if the NPC is feeling sad, they might respond differently to a conversation about their favorite hobby than they would to a conversation about their favorite food. By tracking these changes, we can simulate the human behavior of putting on a front or acting differently based on the situation. Additionally, we can also track the NPC's emotional state over time and use that information to predict how they will respond to future situations.

- We should have something like a core beliefs.md file that outlines the NPC's core beliefs and values. This can help us understand how the NPC will respond to different situations and can also be used to track changes in their beliefs over time. Additionally, we can use this information to predict how the NPC will respond to future situations based on their core beliefs and values. We should make this dynamic, so that the NPC's beliefs and values can change over time based on their experiences and interactions with the world. It should be reasonably hard to change these beliefs and values, but not impossible. We should also have a way to track the NPC's progress towards their goals and values, and use that information to predict how they will respond to future situations. Shocking or extremly emotinal events should be able to change the NPC's beliefs and values, but it should be difficult to do so.
- Around core beliefs, we need to find a way to track small changes, so NPCs and players can chip away at them over time. This can be done by tracking the NPC's emotional state over time and using that information to predict how they will respond to future situations. Additionally, we can also track the NPC's progress towards their goals and values, and use that information to predict how they will respond to future situations. Shocking or extremly emotinal events should be able to change the NPC's beliefs and values, but it should be difficult to do so.
